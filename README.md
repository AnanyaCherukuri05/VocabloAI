## 📘 VocabloAI – Smart Vocabulary Tool

### 📝 Project Overview

**VocabloAI** is an AI-powered vocabulary assistant that helps users quickly learn new words. Users can input any word and receive:

* A clear **definition**
* Relevant **synonyms & antonyms**
* Multiple **example sentences** (in different contexts)

It also provides extra learning aids like **Word of the Day**, **Favorites/Word Bank**, and even **interactive quizzes** to make learning fun and engaging.

All responses are structured using AI function calls or APIs for consistency and clarity.
